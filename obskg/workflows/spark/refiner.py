"""Refiner phase of the SPARK research workflow.

The refiner mediates between the AI analysis and the human user,
producing polished notes or recommendations.  It may solicit
human feedback, apply edits and filter out unhelpful content.

The implementation here simply passes through the analysis report and
wraps it in a list for consistency with later phases.
