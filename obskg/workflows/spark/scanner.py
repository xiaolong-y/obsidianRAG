"""Scanner phase of the SPARK research workflow.

This module defines the ``SPARKScanner`` class responsible for
collecting raw content from various sources such as RSS feeds, web pages
and audio/video files.  It optionally integrates with transcription
services (e.g. Whisper) to convert spoken content into text.  A
relevance filter is applied to reduce the volume of collected material
before further processing.

Because network access and external services are out of scope for this
example, the implementation below focuses on structure and logging
rather than fully functional web scraping or transcription.
