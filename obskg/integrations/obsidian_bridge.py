"""Bridge between Python backend and Obsidian plugins.

This module defines functions and classes that expose the backend
functionality of ``obskg`` to a TypeScript/JavaScript plugin running
inside Obsidian.  Communication can be implemented via HTTP
endpoints, local sockets or file‐based messaging.

The current implementation simply defines a placeholder class that
could be extended to handle requests from the plugin and return
results such as search hits or summaries.
